# ROS2-Humble-Turtle-Bot
This project details the "rover," a mobile robot built on the ROS 2 Humble framework. It's fully simulated in Gazebo using a URDF model, with its state broadcast by robot_state_publisher and visualized in RViz. The robot's core function is autonomous 2D navigation, relying on a LiDAR sensor for perception.
